# AI Prompts for Phased Document Repository Development

## Overview
These prompts are designed to build a document repository system in 5 independent phases, each consumable within 6 credits and buildable without dependencies on future phases.

---

# PHASE 1: Core Backend Foundation & Database

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build the backend foundation with database models, basic API structure, and file handling. This phase creates a working API that can be tested independently.

## ðŸ“‹ AI Prompt for Phase 1

```
Create a FastAPI backend for a document repository system with the following requirements:

TECHNICAL STACK:
- FastAPI with async/await
- MongoDB with Motor (async driver) 
- JWT authentication
- File upload handling
- Python 3.9+

DATABASE MODELS (Use UUIDs, not ObjectIDs):
1. Users: id(uuid), username, email, full_name, role(admin/policy_manager/user), is_approved(bool), is_active(bool), is_suspended(bool), is_deleted(bool), password_hash, created_at
2. Categories: id(uuid), name, code(uppercase), description, is_active(bool), is_deleted(bool), created_at  
3. PolicyTypes: id(uuid), name, code(uppercase), description, is_active(bool), is_deleted(bool), created_at
4. Policies: id(uuid), policy_number, title, category_id, policy_type_id, date_issued, version(int), status(active/archived/hidden/deleted), owner_department, file_url, file_name, is_visible_to_users(bool), created_by, created_at, modified_by, modified_at

CORE API ENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT:
- POST /api/auth/login (username/password â†’ JWT token)
- POST /api/auth/register (create new user, requires approval)
- GET /api/auth/me (get current user info)
- GET /api/categories (list categories)
- POST /api/categories (create category)
- GET /api/policy-types (list policy types)
- POST /api/policy-types (create policy type)
- POST /api/policies (create policy with file upload)
- GET /api/policies (list policies with filtering)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use environment variables for MongoDB connection and JWT secret
2. Create /uploads directory for file storage
3. Support PDF and DOCX file uploads only
4. Generate policy numbers: CATEGORY-TYPE-001-YYYY-v1 format
5. Hash passwords with bcrypt
6. Implement proper error handling and validation
7. Add CORS middleware for frontend integration

DEFAULT DATA TO CREATE:
- Admin user: username="admin", password="admin123"
- Categories: Operations(OPS), HR(HR), IT(IT)  
- Policy Types: Policy(P), Procedure(PR), Guideline(G)

FILE STRUCTURE:
- server.py (main FastAPI app)
- requirements.txt (dependencies)
- .env (environment variables)
- uploads/ (directory for files)

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- All endpoints should return proper HTTP status codes
- File upload should validate file types
- Authentication should work with JWT tokens
- Database operations should handle errors gracefully

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Can login with admin credentials
- Can create categories and policy types
- Can upload a document policy
- All endpoints return valid JSON responses
- No errors in server logs

IMPORTANT: This is Phase 1 only. Do not implement public endpoints or advanced features yet. Focus on core CRUD operations and authentication.
```

**Estimated Credits: 4-5 credits**
**Dependencies: None**
**Testing: Use curl commands to test all endpoints**

# ðŸš€ Phase Execution Guide

## Credit Optimization Tips
1. **Focus on requirements only** - don't add extra features
2. **Use existing libraries** - don't rebuild common functionality
3. **Copy-paste code patterns** - reuse similar implementations
4. **Test incrementally** - verify each component works before proceeding
5. **Document issues clearly** - help AI understand what to fix

## Phase Independence Verification

**After each phase, verify:**
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Previous phase functionality still works
- [ ] New features are accessible and functional
- [ ] No broken API endpoints
- [ ] Database migrations (if any) complete successfully

## Inter-Phase Testing Commands

**Phase 1 Testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/auth/login -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/categories -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Phase 2 Testing:**
- Visit frontend URL
- Login with admin credentials
- Verify navigation works

**Phase 3 Testing:**
```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/public/policies
curl -X GET localhost:3000/ # Should show public interface
```

**Phase 4 Testing:**
- Login as admin
- Test each tab in dashboard
- Create/edit/delete test records

**Phase 5 Testing:**
- Upload a real PDF document
- Test PDF viewer functionality
- Test embedded widget

## Rollback Strategy
If any phase fails:
1. **Revert to previous working state**
2. **Identify specific failing component**
3. **Re-run phase with additional context about the failure**
4. **Test each component individually**

## Success Metrics Per Phase
- **Phase 1:** All API endpoints return 200/201/404 as expected
- **Phase 2:** Can login and see dashboard
- **Phase 3:** Public interface loads and shows documents
- **Phase 4:** Can perform CRUD operations on all entities
- **Phase 5:** Can view PDFs and embed widget works

Each prompt is designed to be self-contained and efficient, building upon the previous phase while ensuring the application remains functional at each step.
