# Document Repository System - Development Phases

## Overview
This document outlines the development phases for transforming the Policy Management System into a public Document Repository suitable for intranet integration.

## Completed Phase 1: Public Access Implementation âœ…

### Backend Changes
- **Public API Endpoints**: Created authentication-free endpoints:
  - `GET /api/public/policies` - List all visible documents with search/filter
  - `GET /api/public/policies/{id}` - Get specific document details
  - `GET /api/public/policies/{id}/download` - Download document file
  - `GET /api/public/categories` - Get active categories
  - `GET /api/public/policy-types` - Get active policy types

- **Security Implementation**: 
  - Only documents marked `is_visible_to_users=true` are accessible
  - Only `active` and `archived` status documents are shown
  - Hidden and deleted documents return 404 for public access

### Frontend Changes
- **Public Interface**: Created `PublicPolicyList` component with:
  - Document browsing table with search and filtering
  - Category and status filters
  - View and download actions for each document
  - Admin login button for administrative access

- **Public PDF Viewer**: Created `PublicPDFViewer` component with:
  - PDF rendering with react-pdf library
  - Zoom controls and page navigation
  - Print and download functionality
  - Mobile-responsive design

- **Routing Structure**: 
  - `/` - Public document list (no authentication)
  - `/document/{id}` - Public PDF viewer (no authentication)
  - `/admin-login` - Admin authentication page
  - `/admin` - Admin dashboard (authentication required)
  - `/admin/policy/{id}` - Admin PDF viewer (authentication required)

### Technical Improvements
- **CORS Fix**: Downloaded local PDF.js worker to resolve CDN CORS issues
- **Performance**: Optimized API calls and component loading
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states for missing documents

## Phase 2: Intranet Integration Design ðŸ”„

### 2.1 Embeddable Components
**Objective**: Make components suitable for embedding in existing intranet sites

#### Backend Modifications Required
- [ ] Add configuration endpoints for theming/branding
- [ ] Create iframe-safe headers (remove X-Frame-Options restrictions)
- [ ] Add JSONP support for cross-origin integration
- [ ] Implement widget-specific API endpoints with minimal response sizes

#### Frontend Modifications Required
- [ ] Create `EmbeddableDocumentWidget` component with:
  - Configurable height/width
  - Optional header/footer
  - Customizable color scheme
  - Minimal CSS footprint to avoid conflicts

- [ ] Add embedding modes:
  - `full-page` - Complete document repository page
  - `widget` - Compact document list widget
  - `search-only` - Just search functionality
  - `category-specific` - Documents from specific categories only

- [ ] Create configuration options:
  ```javascript
  const widgetConfig = {
    mode: 'widget|full-page|search-only|category-specific',
    theme: {
      primaryColor: '#1e40af',
      backgroundColor: '#f8fafc',
      textColor: '#1e293b'
    },
    features: {
      showSearch: true,
      showFilters: true,
      showDownload: true,
      showCategories: ['operations', 'hr', 'it']
    },
    layout: {
      compact: true,
      showHeader: false,
      maxHeight: '400px'
    }
  };
  ```

### 2.2 CSS/Styling Isolation
- [ ] Implement CSS-in-JS or scoped CSS to prevent style conflicts
- [ ] Create theme provider for consistent styling
- [ ] Add CSS reset for embedded components
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints for various container sizes

### 2.3 Integration Methods
- [ ] **Iframe Integration**: Self-contained widget with postMessage communication
- [ ] **JavaScript Widget**: Direct embedding with initialization script
- [ ] **Web Components**: Custom HTML elements for modern browsers
- [ ] **React Component**: For React-based intranet sites

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Environment Setup
1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js 16+, Python 3.9+, MongoDB 5.0+
2. **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await patterns
3. **Frontend**: React 18+ with hooks and context
4. **Database**: MongoDB with proper indexing for search performance
5. **File Storage**: Local storage with option for S3/cloud storage

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for document workflows
- E2E tests for user journeys
- Performance testing for large document sets
- Security testing for public access controls

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all public endpoints
- File type validation and virus scanning
- Rate limiting on public APIs
- Content Security Policy headers
- Regular security audits

### Deployment Strategy
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database migration scripts
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring and logging setup
